# Step 02: Setup Build Environment

## Actions

1.  **Receive Parameters:** Get the `validated_build_params` from the previous step.
2.  **Checkout Source Code:** Check out the `main` branch (or the specific branch intended for this release).
3.  **Install Dependencies:** Run commands to install necessary build dependencies (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install`).
4.  **Configure Tools:** Set up any required build tools or environment variables.
5.  **Prepare Output:** Confirm environment readiness and provide the path to the build directory.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Correct source code version is checked out.
*   All build dependencies are installed successfully.
*   Build tools and environment are configured correctly.
*   `environment_setup_report` confirms readiness.
*   `build_directory_path` is provided.

## Error Handling

*   If source checkout fails, dependency installation fails, or configuration errors occur, proceed to `EE_handle_env_error.md` (if defined).
